\title{Shrinkage Estimator for Covariance Matrix}
\usage{
shrinkage_est(resid, lambda = NULL, zero_mean = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{resid}{A numeric matrix of residuals.}

\item{lambda}{Numeric; the shrinkage intensity in [0, 1]. If missing, it is computed.}

\item{zero_mean}{Logical; if TRUE, residuals are assumed to have zero mean. Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
  \item{lambda}{the optimal shrinkage intensity}
  \item{cov.shr}{the shrinkage covariance matrix}
}
\description{
Estimates a covariance matrix using a shrinkage approach. The sample
covariance matrix is shrunk toward a target matrix (the diagonal matrix of
sample variances) using a shrinkage intensity lambda. If lambda is not
provided, it is computed from the variance of the sample correlations.
